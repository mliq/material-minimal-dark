Material-inspired, Minimal-distraction, beautiful and calming blue and purple focused color palette VSCode theme.

* Documentation is meant to be written and read, so comments are not invisible.
* Minimizes distractions by avoiding meaningless differentiations just to add more color
* Avoid harsh, bright colors except when attention really needs to be drawn / can be drawn without overwhelming view.

Note: mainly developed for Javascript/React, happy to receive MRs for bringing other Language Modes up to par.
